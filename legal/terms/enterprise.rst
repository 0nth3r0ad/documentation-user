===========================================
Odoo Enterprise Subscription Agreement v4.2
===========================================

..     TODO what about the clause to publish references ?

By subscribing to the Odoo Enterprise services (the "Services") provided by Odoo SA in relation
with Odoo Enterprise Edition or Odoo Community Edition (the "Software"), you (the "Customer")
are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Agreement").

Term of the Agreement
=====================

The duration of this agreement (the “Term”) shall be minimally one (1) year starting on the
date of the signature of the Agreement. It is tacitly renewed for an equal Term, unless either
party provides a 90 days prior written notice of termination by registered mail.

Definitions
===========

User
    Any employee, contractor, customer or vendor of the Customer who receives access to the
    Software in creation and/or edition mode. External users who only use the Software through
    the portal facilities ("Portal Users") are not counted as users.

Confidential information
    Any information designated as such by either party in writing, along with any
    information related to the business, affairs, products, developments, trade secrets,
    know-how, personnel, customers and suppliers of either party, or any information which may
    reasonably be regarded as confidential.

Bug
    Any failure of the Software that results in a complete stop or error traceback, or any security
    breach. The decision of whether any other Customer issue or request qualifies as a Bug
    is solely at the discretion of Odoo SA. Some examples:

    - Non-compliance of features with country-specific legal requirements may be
      considered Bugs if that particular feature is explicitly supported for the specified country.
    - Unexpected behaviors or security breaches due to defective configuration or installation
      are not considered Bugs.

Covered Versions
    All Services provided under this Agreement are applicable to the Covered Versions of
    the Software, which include the 3 (three) most recent released versions.

    To be covered by the current Agreement, Customer’s installations have to run the most recent
    released version at the time of this agreement’s signature. When this is not the case,
    additional costs are applicable, as described in `Charges`_.


Access to Odoo Enterprise Edition
=================================

Odoo gives the Customer the right to use (execute, modify, execute after modification) any Odoo Enterprise Edition software, under the terms set forth in the Appendix 1 of this agreement, and for the duration of the agreement. Should the contract be terminated, the access to the Odoo Enterprise edition will be revoked. An access to the software and to the source code is also provided.
Notwithstanding the above, the Customer commits to wholly preserve the integrity of the Odoo Enterprise edition code that is required to verify the validity of usage of Odoo Enterprise edition and collects statistics that are needed for that purpose, including but not limited to the running of an instance, the number of registered and active users, and other data that may be required.
The Customer understands that his instance(s) need(s) to be connected to the Internet at least once a month so that the validity of his instance(s) can be tested against his Odoo Enterprise contract by exchanging key data between servers of Odoo SA and the Customer’s instance(s). Odoo commits not to disclose individual (ie. named) figures to third parties without the agreement of the Customer. Odoo commits to give appropriate notice of at least 15 days, in the software, should a divergence be found between contract data and what is returned by the Customer’s instance(s) before taking actions.

Services
========

Bug Fixing Service
------------------

For the duration of this Agreement, an unlimited warranty in tickets for Bugs related to Odoo Enterprise is provided. Customer-specific modules are not covered by this warranty. All parties acknowledge that as specified in the license under which Odoo is published, the software may include bugs and the vendor cannot be held liable for them.
Odoo commits to open maintenance tickets in less than 2 business days (from Monday to Friday included).
As soon as the Bug is fixed a patch will be communicated to the Customer.
If the bug has already been addressed through updates of the version used by the Customer, the Customer will be asked to update his system to this build. However, if the patch is only available for more recent versions than the one used by the Customer, Odoo will provide the patch and will not require the Customer to migrate to benefit from this patch. When Odoo fixes the Bug in the Customer's version, it commits to cover the issue into all more recent versions.

Security Alert Service
----------------------

Customer will be informed as soon as a security issue is fixed. This service includes providing updates which address the threat in a timely manner. The availability of the new release will only be publicly announced a few weeks after the first announcement to Customers in order to allow them to upgrade safely to the new version prior to the public announcement.

Upgrade Service
---------------

Upgrade Service for Odoo Enterprise
Under the current Agreement, Customers can request an upgrade on demand. Upgrade services cover the migration from any version of Odoo to a more recent release. Detailed information is to be found at http://upgrade.odoo.com. Once Customer uploads his database on the Odoo upgrade platform, Odoo will upgrade his data, perform tests, and deliver the upgraded version in a secured test environment. Customer has then to test and validate it before reprocessing an up-to-date database for the final upgrade. For security reasons, if Customer does not want to share his data, Odoo offers a tool that anonymizes all the data prior to him submitting his database to Odoo. In that case, Customer sends a database where all sensitive data has been anonymized. After the upgrade process, this module will reverse the anonymization of the data.
Upgrade services only covers the technical aspects of the migration. Odoo Services do not cover elements such as, but not limited to, the impact of new features and functions in the design of the software or daily usage by the users.
Optional Upgrade Service for third-party modules
Under the current Agreement, Customer can request optional upgrade services, subject to additional fees, for third-party modules that are not part of the Odoo Enterprise software. Odoo will adapt these to the new version and upgrade all related data. The Customer will receive a new version of his modules as well as its upgraded database. The service guarantees that the features available in the previous version will still be available in the new version. This service does not include a full review of the quality of the code provided by Customer.


Charges
=======

Standard charges
----------------

The charges for the Odoo Enterprise software, the bug fixing service, security alert service and the upgrade service are based on the number of Users, per the definition in section 2.2 “Users” and the release Customer is using. If during the Term of the Agreement, the real number of Users were to exceed the stated number of Users under section 7 “Agreement Registration”, Customer commits to pay for the additional users at full public price for the remainder of the Term. Section 6 covers the agreed upon standard charges. If at the time of the signature of the Agreement, Customer uses one of the Covered Versions that is not the most recent release, the standard charges will be increased by an extra 50% for the first year only.

Renewal charges
---------------

Up to ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of any renewal Term, Odoo shall have the right to notify Customer of an increase of the fees applicable during the renewal Term. The applicable fees (ie. price per user) can be increased by a maximum (cap) of 10% compared to the previous period. This capping is not applicable to any increase of charges resulting of an increase of other drivers of the charges, such as the number of users. If the legal representative of Customer indicates his disagreement as described in section 1 “Term of the Agreement”, the contract will be automatically terminated, without any refund. In case of a multi-year Agreement when the charges are defined for two or more consecutive years, this provision will only apply at the very end of the multi-year Agreement.

Charges for Upgrade Services of third-party modules
---------------------------------------------------

The charge for the upgrade service for third-party modules (not included in the Odoo Enterprise software) is EUR1,000 per 1,000 Lines of Code, exclusive of all taxes.
The lines of code include all developed code such as but not limited to Python (.py), Javascript(.js), Extensible Markup Language (.xml), Report Markup language (.rml), and HTML, hereafter “Lines of Code”. Lines of Code also include the data (.csv), but exclude lines of comment. The number of Lines of Code will be rounded up to the next thousand. When the code of those modules is found to be of bad quality, such as, but not limited to, foreign key inconsistencies, modules not being installable, etc, Odoo reserves the right to charge additional fees for remediation. In that case, Odoo shall report the reasons for bad quality to Customer and will formulate a quotation for the corrective work.
Additionally, for the upgrade of all third-party modules constituting an interface with a third party software or system, a separate quotation will be established and the corresponding services will be billed separately.

======================

Customer Obligations

- immediately notify Odoo if the actual number of Users and/or Apps, exceeds the numbers corresponding to the Agreement and shall pay the difference for the remaining period of the Agreement;

- take all measures necessary to protect Customer’s files and databases and to ensure Customer’s data is safe and secure, including prior to any intervention by Odoo. Odoo will accept no liability for any loss of data or security breaches;
- authorize Odoo to access Customer’s IT systems to measure the accuracy of the number of Apps and Users declared by Customer under this Agreement.

- Upon completion of section 7 “Agreement Registration”, Customer has to return the signed Agreement to Odoo via email to contracts@odoo.com or by surface mail to Odoo s.a., Avenue Edmond Van Nieuwenhuyse, 5 ; 1160 Bruxelles; Belgium

Charges and Other Financial Provisions
--------------------------------------

The Parties agree that such amount is fair and reasonable and accurately reflects the reasonable value of the non-defaulting Party’s recruiting, training, and educational expenses associated with the replacement of such employee.

Publicity
---------

Unless the Customer notifies Odoo otherwise, Customer grants to Odoo a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to reproduce and display Customer’s name, logos and trademarks solely for the purpose of referring to Customer as Odoo’s customer on Odoo’s websites, in press releases and in other marketing materials.

Termination
-----------
In the event that either Party fails to fulfil any of its obligations arising hereunder, and if such breach has not been remedied within thirty (30) calendar days from the written notice of such breach, this Agreement may be terminated immediately by the non-breaching Party. Further, Odoo may terminate the Agreement immediately in the event Customer fails to pay the applicable annual fees for the Services within the due date specified on the corresponding invoice.

Warranty
--------
Odoo warrants that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services in accordance with the generally accepted industry standards and further provided that: (i) the code of Odoo Enterprise has not been modified, changed, or altered; (ii) the Customer’s IT systems are in good operational order and Odoo  is installed in a suitable operating environment;  (iii) the Customer provides adequate troubleshooting information and access so that Odoo can identify, reproduce and address problems; and (iv) all amounts due to Odoo have been paid. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and Odoo's only obligation for any breach of the foregoing warranty is for Odoo to perform again the services at no additional charge.
There are no other warranties of any kind, whether express or implied or statutory. Odoo does not warrant that the App or module, or the service complies with any local or international law or regulations. Customer shall be solely responsible for monitoring, enforcing and complying with any law or regulation applicable for its business.

Limitation of Liability

Multiple claims shall not enlarge this limitation. In no event will Odoo be liable for any indirect, special, exemplary, incidental or consequential damages of any kind, including but not limited to loss of revenue, profits, savings, loss of business or other financial loss, costs of standstill or delay, lost or corrupted data, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including strict negligence) or any other legal or equitable theory, even if Odoo has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 

Confidentiality
---------------
In the event either party obtains access to the Confidential Information of the other party in the course of performing under this Agreement, the party obtaining such information shall maintain the confidentiality of such information in the same manner it maintains the confidentiality of its own similar Confidential Information, but in no event with less than reasonable care. 

Force Majeure
-------------
